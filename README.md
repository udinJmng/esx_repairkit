# esx_repairkit [![Release](https://img.shields.io/badge/Release-V%203.2-blue)](https://github.com/clementinise/esx_repairkit/releases/latest)

RepairKit script for FiveM ESX servers - https://forum.cfx.re/t/fork-esx-esx-repairkit-repairkit-item-for-car/1133523

## FEATURES
* Repair Kit Item & Tyre Kit Item
* Update Checker on resource start
* More realistic since it needs you to be next to the engine or near the tyre to actually repair
* It only repair the engine of your vehicle, not the "visual aspect" of it
* Player can abort the repair by pressing "X"
* Message if players attempt to repair the car and are not in front of the tyre or engine
* French, English, Swedish language included
## RepairKit & TyreKit easily configurable: 
* **Config.InfiniteRepairs & Config.InfiniteRepairsTyreKit** 
Toggle Infinite RepairKit & TyreKit (One Kit last forever)
* **Config.RepairTime & Config.TyreKitTime**
Set in seconds, how long should a repair take
* **Config.IfMecaIsOnline** 
Toggle If Mechanic is online then players can't use the kit and need to call the Mechanic to fix it
* **Config.IgnoreAbort & Config.IgnoreTyreAbort** 
Toggle Remove RepairKit & TyreKit if players abort the repair
* **Config.AllowMecano** 
Toggle if Mechanic can use the RepairKit & TyreKit
* **Config.RealisticVehicleFailure**
 If you're using [Realistic Vehicle Failure](https://forum.cfx.re/t/release-realistic-vehicle-failure/57801) then you can set it to true (Since “RealisticVehicleFailure” change how cars work, this config option allow to set the engine repair value lower than usual so the repaired vehicle is not indestructible)
* **Config.DestroyChance**
The lower it is, the more it has a chance to make the engine fail and the car explode. (1 = 100%, 2 = 50%, 4 = 25%, 10 = 10%, 100 = 1%, etc)
*If you don't want this feature, set **Config.DestroyOnFailedRepair** to false*
* **Config.EnableProgressBar**
If you don't want a progress bar when your player use the item or you don't want to use any dependencies ([progressBar](https://forum.cfx.re/t/release-progress-bars-1-0-standalone/526287)) then set it to **false**
* **Config.MechanicNameJob**
If your mechanic job is not named "mecano", you can change it here



Some new features will be added soon:  t̶i̶r̶e̶ ̶k̶i̶t̶,̶ ̶%̶ ̶f̶a̶i̶l̶u̶r̶e̶,  can't be used again after X times, change key for cancelling the repair in config file, etc
